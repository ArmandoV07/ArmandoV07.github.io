        <p class="p2">I don’t think games are everything but it has helped me in a way or another. Another hobby I got
            into recently is going to the gym. I really like going to the gym. Something about it is really calming and
            relaxing. I get to get out the rest of my energy for the day and rest at home. It helps that it is a good
            way to exercise and get my energy out.</p>
        <p>One of my hobbies is playing video games. I know shocker but it is something I enjoy doing. Coming home from
            school then going to work doesn’t give me much time to do much of anything. The two things I have time for
            is homework and video games. I’ve played video games for a majority of my life and it holds a spot in my
            heart. I’ve met some of the best friends I could ever ask for through playing video games. It let me connect
            with people from different backgrounds from hundreds of miles away.</p>
